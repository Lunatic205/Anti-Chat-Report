<h1> Version </h1>

This plug-in was created for Minecraft 1.19.2.

It's a new plugin in its early stages that we've been testing for a few months and have only recently decided to release the finished version 1.0.5.

<h1> About </h1>

This plugin was created to disable the recently installed chat report mechanism in Minecraft.

It removes cryptographic signatures from player messages,
Making it impossible to monitor and link them to your Mojang/Microsoft account or use the Player Chat Reporting tool.

<h1> The Development Team </h1>

This plugin was written by Lunatic205, the main developer, and 2995, the main graphic designer.

If you come across any bugs, please let us know.
